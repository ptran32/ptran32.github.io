title: Collect kubernetes logs with fluentbit and elasticsearch

If you're running a kubernetes environment, you probably need to collect logs from your pods.

You've got different choices from paid to opensource tool, in this post, I'll choose [fluentbit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/) because it's lightweight and has a helm chart I can use.

## Concept

Logging in kubernetes is something dynamic, every new application running in the cluster should be able to send his logs without any human intervention. Thanks to daemonSet object, which allow us to run a pod on any nodes inside a cluster.

I remember few years ago, when I used nagios and I had to add manually every single new host to be able to monitor it. It was painful.

**The log stream is represented by this diagram**

![Fluentbit flow](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LKKSx-3LBTCtaHbg0gl%2F-LKKTm4Y55lytnFhqfG1%2F-LKKTwUrRtRcGfkhN7YV%2Flogging_pipeline_input.png?alt=media)


This log stream is declared in different sections inside fluent-bit.conf

***Service (not present on diagram)***: the global configuration of fluentbit

***Input***: the source of logs file, could be syslog, tail, tcp, docker event

**Parser**: Read the source, find pattern and transform the structure.

**Filter**: Enrich your logs with new metadatas

**Buffer**: When data is ready to be senf to the destination (output), 
fluentbit keep it in memory by default

***Output***: Where to send datas (elasticsearch, influxdb, kafka, splunk...)


## Requirements


- A functional Elasticsearch
- A functional Kibana
- Kubernetes installed (I used [k3s](https://k3s.io/), but you can use any installer)
- Helm installed. (I used Helm3, but you can also use version2 as well.) 

## Install fluentbit 

Before started, make sure you have all requirements above.

Fetch the last values.yaml file from official stable repo.

```
wget https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/fluent-bit/values.yaml
```

You need to replace *type*, *host* and *port*. Optionnaly, also replace *http_user*, *http_passwd*, *tls* and *tls_verify* if your elasticsearch cluster has TLS enabled.

```
backend:
  type: es
  forward:
    host: fluentd
    port: 24284
    tls: "off"
    tls_verify: "on"
    tls_debug: 1
    shared_key:
  es:
    host: "172.31.36.188"
    port: 9200
    # Elastic Index Name
    index: kubernetes_cluster
    type: flb_type
    logstash_prefix: kubernetes_cluster
    replace_dots: "On"
    logstash_format: "On"
    retry_limit: "False"
    time_key: "@timestamp"
    # Optional username credential for Elastic X-Pack access
    http_user: YOURUSER
    # Password for user defined in HTTP_User
    http_passwd: YOURPASSWORD
    # Optional TLS encryption to ElasticSearch instance
    tls: "on"
    tls_verify: "off"
```

Deploy fluentbit. Configuration set above will be store as a configMap. 

```
helm install  my-release stable/fluent-bit -f values.yaml
```

Verify everything is ok in the pod

```
kubectl logs -f my-release-fluent-bit-7vgv9

```

If connection cannot be made with elasticsearch, you will have errors like below

```

### Verify Elasticsearch received datas and created the index

Fluentbit creates daily index with the pattern kubernetes_cluster-YYYY-MM-DD, verify that your index has been created on elasticsearch.

![ES Monitoring](https://github.com/ptran32/ptran32.github.io/blob/master/_posts/img/05-fluentbit-es.png?raw=true)

If everything is ok, you can create an index pattern with kubernetes*, which will allow you to display the index documents from the UI.


### Generate logs and verify they appear on Kibana

I used this project ro generate random logs: [https://github.com/mingrammer/flog](https://github.com/mingrammer/flog)

```
kubectl run log-gen --image mingrammer/flog
```

You should now see your logs with all kubernetes metadatas added by fluentbit.

## Conclusion

This is a sample of what you can do with log collection in a kubernetes cluster, there's actually a lot of engineering behind like define a standard for logs coming from different formats across your platform or high availability setup.

Peace out ;)
